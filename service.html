        <h1>We Are One <br>as Jesus In Us</h1>
        <p>In Jesus, we're united, serving Him together as one. This unity, beyond differences, is what Ephesians 4:5 and Galatians 3:28 talk aboutâ€”there's no divide in Christ. Jesus' wish in John 17:21, for us to be as one like He is with the Father, shows how deep this unity goes. We, as different parts of one body, work together, like 1 Corinthians 12:12 says. We're meant to be together, helping each other, just as Romans 12:5 explains that in Christ, we're all part of one big family. <br>   
            <br>
            When we gather in His name, Jesus is with us, as promised in Matthew 18:20. This gathering is our strength, driven by a shared purpose and love, like Philippians 2:2 inspires us. Our faith journey, aiming for unity in Jesus, is powered by love, the kind that Colossians 3:14 describes as the perfect bond. Together, in faith and love, we live out Jesus' teachings, united in our mission and spirit in Him.</p>
